* the extension works silently in the background
  * removes all page content except the iframe that contains an embedded video player
  * dramatically reduces CPU load
* after installation, an icons is added to the "Chrome toolbar"
  * there is no way for the extension to prevent this from happening
  * to hide ( but [not remove](https://superuser.com/questions/1048619) ) it, you can right-click on the icon and select: "Hide in Chrome menu"
